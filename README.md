This project aims to develop a data-driven model to classify water as potable or non-potable 
using chemical characteristics of water. The analysis also seeks to uncover which chemical 
properties are most critical to water potability and safety, and to extract scientifically 
meaningful insights that support real-world environmental monitoring and decision-making.

To run the code, you have to use jupyter notebook or google colab
